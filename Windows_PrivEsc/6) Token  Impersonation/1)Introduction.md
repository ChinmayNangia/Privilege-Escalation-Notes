what are tokens ?
tokens are the temporary keys that required you to access network/web without using credentials every time you want to access that resource

2 types of token 
1) Delegate - created for logging into a machine or RDP 
2) Impersonate - "non-interactive " attaching a network drive or domain logon script



for checking whether token impersonation is allowed  
**whoami /priv**
